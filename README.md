## Software Requirements

This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook

Udacity recommends our students install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.


This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
